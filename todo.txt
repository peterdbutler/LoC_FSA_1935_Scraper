1935 HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES:
- build script to sort downloaded files 
    - place all resolutioned images into single folder for ea. record? (53k Records)
- determine if ALL tiffs have been downloaded
    - possible use of fsa1935_tifs*.csv
    - logs may help in Spiders/.logs/
- check status of jpegs, confirm fully downloaded
    - possible use of fsa1935_jpegs*.csv
    - logs may help in Spiders/.logs/
- use FSA_Records to generate and fill metadata for tiffs (low priority)

IMAGE PREPROCESSING
- generate training data:
    - build module to shape images to square
    - generate training data to populate copies of squared images with centered holes
    - repeat for images with rotations and mirros to generate more train data

TRAIN MODEL
- check ideal algorithms for this detail
